  <p align="center">
    A graphical script manager driven by configuration files
  </p>
</div>

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a graphical interface for programs with complex user configurations. Developers do not need to write additional code, but only need to provide and use configuration files according to specific requirements to create a GUI for their programs. At the same time, for users, it allows for centralized management of multiple program scripts, which is very suitable for tasks that require periodic execution.

## Highlights

- Generate GUI from configuration files in JSON/YAML/TOML formats
- Manage and run multiple task instances with one click
- Automatically pull code from remote repositories and create interfaces
- Automatically manage Python virtual environments and update dependencies
- Support for multiple languages
